Typing Game
This is a simple typing game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game displays a random sentence from a predefined list of sentences, and the player needs to type the sentence as accurately and quickly as possible. The game calculates the typing speed in characters per minute and displays it to the player.
Getting Started

To run the game, simply open the typing-master.html file in a web browser.

How to Play
1. When the game starts, a random sentence will be displayed in the text area.
2. Type the sentence in the input field provided.
3. As you type, the game will highlight the correct characters in yellow and the incorrect characters in red.
4. The remaining characters that you haven't typed yet will be displayed after the highlighted text.
5. Once you have finished typing the entire sentence, the game will calculate your typing speed in characters per minute and display it below the input field.

Customization
If you want to add or modify the sentences used in the game, you can do so by modifying the texts array in the JavaScript code. Simply add or remove sentences as needed.
